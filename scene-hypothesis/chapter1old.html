**The Clustering of Excellence**

In 1925, Alexander Bell's AT&T founded Bell Labs, where both scientific research and practical engineering would happen in the same place. By the 20th century, it was accepted that universities did research while businesses did profitable engineering. Bell Labs broke that pattern, and more effectively than universities or corporations, to such a degree that their success couldn't be assigned to merely the quality of their talent---not when Cambridge had just as much talent, even more. Having given us the transistor, the laser, information theory, Unix, and cellular telephony, Bell Labs has been studied and dreamt of for decades by STEM-lovers and those curious about the nature of innovation. It has never been replicated exactly, but many of our greatest successes of clustered innovation resemble it in some way. There isn't a single piece of modern technology in our daily lives that is not dependent on some Bell Labs invention or discovery, though very few could name the inventors.

Six hundred years ago in Florence, an artistic hopeful would have at some point wandered into some master's workshop. Part classroom, part factory, part laboratory of the arts, many an artistic hopeful were incubated in Florence's *botteghe* 600 years ago. The western art tradition was being transformed mostly by one city.

Meanwhile, as Bell Labs was at its peak, a group of young American men were beginning a tradition of rejecting everything to do with the American dream and what it asked of them, and in doing so created the most influential and most American artistic movement since Walt Whitman. Even most learned people today don't recognize the names of Ginsberg, Burroughs, Kerouac, Corso, and the other members of the Beat Generation, but people all over the world use words and phrases they invented, devour art inspired by them. More importantly, nearly a century later, the global archetype of youth, and more specifically American coming-of-age, is a Beat Gen youth. There is no coming of age media that is devoid of Beat influence.

What these examples share isn't obvious at first glance. Bell Labs was a corporate facility. Renaissance Florence was a city with guild structures. The Beats were deliberately anti-institutional. Yet all three were *scenes*---and understanding what that means reveals something fundamental about how excellence emerges.

**What Makes a Scene?**

When I say scene, I mean a loose organic collection of peers in a field. A loose collection of people doing interesting work who are aware of each other and occasionally interact, creating a sense that "something is happening here."

It is not necessarily formal collaboration but mutual awareness. Social proximity is necessary by definition, but geographic proximity is not always necessary. They operate with shared values or goals and have their own status systems, differing in some way from wider society. Norms of its own.

**Not Formal Organizations**

Scenes are not necessarily formal institutions, intentional networks or top-down organized. No one issues membership cards to a scene. There are no official meetings, no hierarchies, no appointed leaders.

The Renaissance workshop scene operated through masters and apprentices, with knowledge flowing through observation and conversation. Bell Labs had formal corporate structure, yes, but the scene that produced innovations emerged from the informal interactions---the long corridor conversations, the spontaneous visits between departments, the habit of leaving doors open. What Bell Labs did well, perhaps accidentally, was that its structure (physical and social) made every individual put together far greater than the sum of its parts.

This organic quality is essential. Scenes are usually organic, sometimes the effect of constraints, rarely completely artificial. It's like an organism with a life cycle.

**Shared Values and Distinct Status Systems**

Scenes operate with shared values or goals and have their own status systems, differing in some way from wider society. The Beats valued spontaneity and rejection of materialism---nearly opposite to 1950s mainstream culture. Renaissance workshops valued technical mastery---a professional ethos distinct from both courtly values and church doctrine.

Crucially, scenes create their own status economies. Within the Beat scene, Ginsberg's approval mattered more than mainstream critical acclaim. Within Bell Labs, respect from fellow researchers held more weight than management titles. These internal status systems allow scenes to maintain standards and direction independent of external pressures.

This autonomy of values is what allows scenes to pursue work that initially appears worthless or impractical. The early abstract expressionists in New York, the early computer hobbyists in Silicon Valley---all operated in scenes with value systems that permitted exploration the outside world considered pointless.

**Peer Networks, Feedback Loops, and Momentum**

Important characteristics of scenes include peer networks, feedback loops and network effects, cross-pollination, and a sense of momentum at their peak.

At their peak, scenes generate the feeling that "something is happening here." This isn't hype. It's the experience of being in an environment where multiple people are tackling interesting problems simultaneously, work is being produced and shared rapidly, ideas are building on each other, and the collective output exceeds what any individual could produce alone.

The scene is the reason why there's the magnetic pull. This becomes self-reinforcing. It attracts more talented people, which increases quality of interaction, which produces more interesting work, which attracts more talent.

But scenes are often but not always permeable. They evolve with the participant group. And like organisms, they have life cycles.

**Scenes as Magnetic Centers**

The most significant scenes don't just contain interesting work---they actively pull in talent and resources. The scene is made of producers and consumers, oftentimes the same people.

Consider certain places at certain times:

**Vienna in the 19th and early 20th century.** The city attracted Freud, Nietzsche, Jung, and others who would reshape psychology and philosophy.

**Paris salon scene.** Hemingway left America for Paris. Picasso came from Spain. They came because Paris offered a scene of experimentation where their work would find informed audiences and stimulating peers.

**Silicon Valley, late 20th to early 21st century.** Wave after wave of ambitious technologists relocated to the Bay Area, often at significant personal cost, because that was where the frontier of computing was being explored.

This magnetism operates on multiple levels. Scenes attract talent---people who want to do important work in a field gravitate toward places where such work is already happening. But scenes also attract resources: capital, institutional support, media attention.

Smart and ambitious people are drawn to good scenes, like magnets. When a scene is thriving, ambitious young people look at it and think: "That's where I need to be." Also, smart/curiosity driven people can see that something interesting is going on there and so they go there. Ambitious people can observe that something special and possibly great is happening there so they go there.

**Where Ambitious People Go**

Throughout history, where ambitious people cluster has shifted dramatically.

Two hundred years ago, ambitious people driven by fame or attention went into stage arts or religious revivalism. The creatively driven became painters or composers or poets. Those who first sought social impact were clergy or abolitionists or reformers or missionaries. People who wanted to build important things to leave behind built infrastructure like railroads, bridges, or steel mills or universities. Intellectually driven people aimed to become scientists or philosophers or inventors. People whose talents and preferences involve wielding power went into military. People who were ambitious but only in the sense of stability, security and status rather than anything unconventional and extreme went into government or church or land ownership.

Fifty years ago in America, people driven by fame or attention went into Hollywood or music performance or politics. Those driven by creativity created literature or films. People who needed social impact were on the ground with civil rights movements, nonprofit organizing, to a lesser degree academia. And if they wanted to "build something that matters"? Large corporations, the once ambitious government agencies like NASA, public works or engineering-heavy projects---aerospace and physical engineering. People with the capacity to manage or support complex multi-actor efforts became CEOs of major corporations, urban planners, or worked in federal agencies. Intellectually driven people still clustered in academic science and research---physics, psychology, computers, economics. People whose talents and preferences involve wielding power went into politics, law, corporate leadership, media ownership. People who were ambitious but only in the sense of stability and security went into medicine, law, accounting, public sector jobs, IBM-style corporate ladders.

And now? Most subsets of ambitious types bunch mostly into two spaces: online content creation and software production.

The larger mass of people who are creatively driven are creating online content. Of course some are focused on their novels after 9-5s or learning to create good work at art school, but most are online. Some visionary mega-project types are trying to build new cities or civil structures. Most are building tech companies. Some people driven by fame are still trying to make it in Hollywood or stage performance. Most are trying to make it as influencers and famous tech founders. Some intellectually driven young people are doing basic science research. Most are software engineers or AI researchers. Some young people whose talents involve wielding power are running for office, but most are building tech companies or yelling at people online. Some social impact types are running social enterprises or being traditional activists, most are trying to influence people to agree with them online or creating tech companies aiming at their conception of good. Some of our hypercompetent striver types are doing strange things in strange places, most are software engineers or project managers or worse, management consultants.

In all these sets of ambitious people, the larger mass congregates in a specific place. And that's the place that makes a difference.

What changed wasn't human nature---it was where the scenes were. Fields attract talent when scenes form around them, and the most vibrant scenes attract disproportionate shares of each generation's ambitious individuals.

If great work requires talent, and talent clusters in scenes, then **the great works of any era will come disproportionately from fields with thriving scenes.**

**The Anatomy of a Scene: Producers and Consumers**

To understand how scenes actually function, we need to examine their internal structure. Scenes are made of producers and consumers. Oftentimes the same people.

**Producers: Wackos and Strivers**

The producers are those creating the work---whether art, knowledge, technology, or something else. But not all producers are motivated in the same way.

**Wackos** are intrinsically motivated. They go into a scene because they are attracted by the problems or puzzles it tackles or by the solutions it offers. It's often a problem or puzzle at the center of it, but sometimes it's just the attraction to or love of a solution that may not yet have a problem. They would work on these things regardless of external rewards. The early amateur radio enthusiasts, the abstract expressionists who painted in poverty, the open-source programmers who contributed for the love of elegant code---these are wackos.

**Strivers** are extrinsically motivated. They go into a scene for rewards like status, money, power, or just external validation. This doesn't make them less talented or hardworking---often they're extraordinarily capable. The MBA graduates who joined tech startups during the dot-com boom, the artists who shifted styles to match gallery trends---these are strivers.

It's crucial to understand that neither type is inherently superior. Wackos are NOT better than strivers. They are just different kinds. While wackos push mainly with intrinsic motivation, strivers push because they are ambitious, sometimes strategic, and the best ones tend to also be disciplined. Strivers are good at creating momentum. The best striver types are excellent at making things happen.

**The ratio between these types determines a scene's trajectory.** Early scenes tend to be wacko-heavy---there's little external reward yet, so only the intrinsically motivated show up. As scenes succeed and become visible, strivers arrive in increasing numbers. An optimal balance exists: enough wackos to maintain direction and standards, enough strivers to provide momentum and resources. But if strivers come to dominate, the scene's culture shifts toward external validation rather than genuine exploration.

Either group may be talented or untalented, or rather, successful within the group or unsuccessful. Successful wackos produce something entirely different from successful strivers. Strivers can produce great work but it just rarely happens.

**Consumers: The Other Half**

On the other end, we have the creators' counterparts, the consumers. For science, that is scientists and inventors. For artists, other artists, art-appreciators and the general public. In business, investors and customers and end-users. In place-making, citizens and visitors.

This group, the consumers, is arguably as important as the creators. Their role is clear. They consume the creations. In doing so they:

**1\. Reward and incentivize creation** by offering social benefits for creating the thing---attention, popularity, reputation---and in some cases, offering other forms of value in exchange, typically money. More consumers also means more people that know the field exists at all.

When there are lots of people ravenously consuming poetry, more people will become poets. When there are lots of AI investors there will be lots of AI companies in response.

**2\. Recognize the great work.**

If there are no consumers, it is far less likely that there will be many creators. And of those that exist, a lack of consumers means that great work is more likely to be undiscovered and upon discovery, more likely to be underrecognized for the potential value it could offer.

Like creators, consumers bunch around trends of curiosity and interest. Individual people will have their personal interests and the things that they are intrinsically curious about. But oftentimes, within spaces, people will be interested in the same things. Part of that is novelty---new fields and subfields will be trendy when their novelty is met with promise, thus attracting attention. A second reason why consumers care about the same fields is because we are human and it is in our nature for our interests to be socially determined. That's how we survive, after all. So consumer interest often compounds and trends form.

In many fields, producers and consumers overlap substantially. Scientists both produce and consume research. Artists make art while observing others' work.

**Characteristics of Functioning Scenes**

When the conditions align---the right mix of producers and consumers, sufficient interaction, shared values---scenes develop characteristic properties.

**Network Effects and Cross-Pollination**

The most obvious characteristic is enhanced communication and collaboration. The quantity over quality thing is actually part of why scenes are effective because so much more is being produced and they're feeding these creations and their creators are feeding off one another. And so there's improvements based on that. So it often works better than a lone genius outside of a scene.

It's similar to how if you want to learn to take a good photo, you could spend some amount of time setting up and taking one good photo, but if you spend the exact same amount of time taking a hundred photos you'll end up with a better photo in there. The same thing happens when you zoom out from the individual and go to the scene. The scene produces more and by feeding off each other---the creations are feeding off one another, the creators are feeding off one another---you end up with something much greater.

It's not just chance. It's also people feeding off each other, explicitly or implicitly. Some basic support is people sharing techniques, cross-pollinating ideas, creating competitive/collaborative pressure, providing informed feedback. So when there's enough of them this feeding is higher quality.

This means that in addition to talented people being present in the mass, at least by chance, they also need to have some concentration within it. Or at least be surrounded by another type of talented people that works well in support of "genius." So concentration matters.

**Feedback Loops and Rapid Iteration**

Scenes compress the feedback cycle between creating work and learning whether it's good. Producers get quick reactions from informed peers. This allows rapid iteration---trying something, getting feedback, adjusting, trying again.

Critically, this feedback comes from people who understand both the difficulty of the work and the standards of quality. The best scenes maintain high standards while encouraging experimentation.

**Status Systems and Cultural Norms**

Scenes create their own status economies independent of broader society's values. Within a scene, prestige comes from scene-specific achievements.

In the Bell Labs scene, brilliant problem-solving earned respect, regardless of whether it led to immediately profitable products. In the Beat scene, authentic expression earned status, even when it meant poverty.

These alternative status systems serve a crucial function: they make it rational to pursue work that the outside world undervalues. If your only source of status is mainstream society, you'll optimize for mainstream rewards. But if you're embedded in a scene with different values, you can pursue work that looks crazy from the outside while still receiving the social validation humans need.

When wackos set the standards, excellence in the thing itself matters most. When strivers dominate, external markers---credentials, affiliations, fashionable topics---start to matter more than actual quality.

**Micro-Cultures with Different Values**

Thriving scenes develop full micro-cultures---shared assumptions, references, inside jokes, unstated norms, and ways of thinking that mark members as part of the group.

These micro-cultures permit deviation from broader cultural norms. In 1950s America, the Beat micro-culture allowed behaviors that would have been socially devastating outside the scene. In Victorian England, the Bloomsbury Group maintained intellectual freedom impossible in mainstream society. In modern tech, startup culture permits risk-taking and failure that would be career-ending in traditional corporations.

This cultural autonomy is essential for innovation. Truly novel ideas almost always violate some established norm. Scenes provide protective bubbles where norm-violation is not just tolerated but celebrated---as long as it serves the scene's intrinsic goals.

**Scenes as Organisms**

It's like an organism with a life cycle. When the scene around a field starts getting lots of new members, there's a point where it's growth, and when it's too extreme, cancer. And as with animals, the age and size of the scene affect chances of cancer developing. The old and the large are both at higher risk of developing a cancer, which only spreads when not swiftly dealt with.

This organic nature means scenes can't be fully controlled or manufactured through top-down design. Like organisms, they emerge from specific conditions and evolve through interaction with their environment.

Understanding scenes as organisms helps explain several puzzling phenomena:

**Why successful scenes are so hard to replicate.** Many cities have tried to recreate Silicon Valley's success by copying visible features---research universities, venture capital, startup-friendly regulations---without producing comparable results. They missed the cultural norms, the specific history of scenes building on previous scenes.

**Why scenes have life cycles.** They start small, attract more participants and develop momentum, reach peak productivity, then eventually decline as conditions change or founding energy dissipates.

**Why scenes require ongoing maintenance.** Like organisms needing food, scenes need sustained attention to conditions that keep them healthy.

Scenes can be healthy or sick. A scene dominated by strivers, where status comes from external validation rather than quality of work, is a sick scene. It might persist, but it won't produce its distinctive benefits.

**The Life Cycle of Scenes**

Scenes follow a predictable developmental arc:

**Genesis: The Wackos Arrive**

**Field emerges from wackos (not necessarily ambitious)** **→** **interesting happenings attract ambitious people.**

Scenes begin with a small number of people drawn to something new or undervalued. These early participants are almost always wackos---intrinsically motivated. There are no external rewards yet.

Often, a scene begins when one person does something odd. Some early person doing something odd. Probably curiosity driven. They see the potential. And they start trying things and maybe doing well, but primarily, they explore and experiment. And it doesn't kill them. Maybe they seem like they're onto something. Or in some cases, like they're having fun.

The emergent phenomenon is the scene: a tiny tiny microclimate of skilled or dreamy (or both) peers who see others have been doing interesting things, giving them permission to try. A feedback loop kicks in and this grows into some critical mass and eventually they develop more ways to cross pollinate: the café, the salon, the loft party, the mailing list, the gallery.

At this stage, the scene is fragile but pure. There's enormous freedom to experiment because there's little at stake.

**Growth: Attracting the Ambitious**

**Field attracts mass of ambitious people** **→** **talented people present by chance.**

As the scene produces impressive work, it becomes visible. This attracts a second wave: talented people who recognize its potential. These include more wackos, but also the first strivers attracted by early signs of opportunity.

This growth phase is often most exciting. The scene maintains much of its exploratory culture but now has enough people for rich interaction. Resources start to flow in. The combination of maintained standards (from early wackos) and increased energy (from new arrivals) often produces a scene's best work.

Fields attract the curious, then the ambitious, then the institutional strivers.

**Maturity: The Golden Age**

**Talented people concentrate and feed off each other** **→** **great work emerges either by supporting geniuses or by the direct collaborative work of the scene.**

At peak maturity, a scene achieves optimal balance. Enough wackos remain to set standards. Enough strivers have arrived to provide energy and resources. There we have the golden moment with a social structure of ambition, experimentation and support. Attracting more and more people and attention in the feedback loop.

The feedback loops are fastest, the concentration of talent highest, the cultural norms most developed. Resources are available but haven't yet corrupted values.

**Decline: Strivers Dominate**

**Success attracts externally motivated people (who don't care about the field but about other things)** **→** **even when they are competent, they dilute the concentration of greatness-producing talent** **→** **they reduce the quality of the existing talent and potential too because they're feeding the animal as well. Plus they change (corrupt?) the larger culture and so the incentives.**

Success itself often triggers decline. As a scene becomes famous and lucrative, it attracts people primarily motivated by external rewards. The ratio of strivers to wackos rises steadily.

Strivers, by their nature, optimize for external validation. They push the scene toward work that impresses outsiders, wins grants, attracts media attention---regardless of whether such work serves the scene's original purpose.

The scene's status system shifts. Instead of prestige flowing from quality of work, it flows from conventional markers: credentials, institutional affiliations, funding raised.

Sometimes this leads to professionalization created by these strivers or well meaning core motivated types. At times this can still look like a peak if there are enough strivers. Great work may still come until there aren't enough high potential people. There needs to be a critical mass of the right kind of drive for the ready high potential people (genius) to do well or for great work to come from scenius rather than genius.

Wackos, finding the scene no longer serves their interests, begin to leave. This creates a vicious cycle: as wackos leave, the scene becomes even more striver-dominated, which drives away more wackos.

**Death: The Hollow Shell**

**Scene quality degrades** **→** **remaining talented people can't thrive** **→** **decline.**

Eventually, a scene may die entirely. Sometimes through sudden external shock---war, economic collapse, political repression. More often, gradually through the dynamic described above.

A dead scene may leave institutional remnants---professional associations, academic departments---but the organic quality is gone. The sense that "something is happening here" vanishes.

Not all scenes must die. Some persist for generations by continuously regenerating. But all scenes face the risk of the success → commercialization → striver dominance → decline cycle.

**When Scenes Become Engines of Decline**

Not all scenes produce positive outcomes. Some scenes become engines of harm rather than progress.

Organized crime syndicates exhibit many scene characteristics: tight networks, shared values distinct from mainstream society, internal status systems, cross-pollination of techniques. The same dynamics that help scientific scenes produce breakthroughs can help criminal scenes become sophisticated.

Political corruption often operates through scene dynamics. Networks of officials and power brokers develop their own norms, status systems---all oriented toward extraction rather than creation. These negative scenes can be remarkably persistent.

Even scenes that start with noble intentions can become counterproductive if they calcify or if their cultural norms drift toward harm. Academic fields sometimes evolve into credentialist scenes where conformity matters more than truth.

We'll explore these dynamics more deeply when we examine specific cases, particularly in Nigeria where negative scenes have proven remarkably powerful. For now, understand that scene dynamics are tools---immensely powerful ones---that can serve any purpose.

**Conclusion: Scenes as the Missing Unit of Analysis**

Fields are made of scenes. Cities are made of scenes. The scene is king.

The concept of scenes provides a missing piece in how we understand human achievement and social development. We typically analyze individuals (biographical history, studies of genius) or large-scale institutions (economic history, political science). But much of what matters happens at the intermediate level of scenes.

Individual genius exists but is rarer than we imagine---and even geniuses typically work better within scenes than in isolation. Large institutions matter but often succeed or fail based on whether they enable scene formation internally.

Understanding scenes helps explain puzzling patterns:

-   Why certain places at certain times produce disproportionate shares of important work
-   Why talented individuals often achieve more when they relocate to where scenes are thriving
-   Why attempts to replicate successful innovation hubs so often fail
-   Why fields experience golden ages followed by long stagnation
-   Why development sometimes takes off rapidly while remaining stubbornly stuck elsewhere

In the chapters that follow, we'll explore how scenes actually generate progress, what conditions allow them to form and thrive, and---most importantly---how understanding scene dynamics might help us address some of humanity's most pressing challenges, particularly the persistent development failures in places like Nigeria.

But first, we must understand the mechanisms more deeply. How exactly do scenes transform individual effort into collective achievement? Why does composition matter so much? And what role do consumers play? These are the questions we turn to next.
