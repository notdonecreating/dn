            <ul>
                <li>Scenes are organic social clusters with shared values and distinct status systems</li>
                <li>Unlike formal organizations, scenes emerge naturally and function as magnetic centers of activity</li>
                <li>Scenes consist of "wackos" (creative innovators) and "strivers" (ambitious adopters), both as producers and consumers</li>
                <li>Scenes develop their own micro-cultures with unique values and status hierarchies</li>
                <li>Like organisms, scenes have life cycles that include potential decline phases</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Scenes transform quantity of activity into quality of output through critical mass</li>
                <li>Creator-consumer dynamics within scenes establish powerful feedback loops</li>
                <li>Peer networks and status rewards drive motivation and excellence</li>
                <li>Magnetic attraction of talent and resources accelerates innovation</li>
                <li>Network effects and cross-pollination of ideas breed novel approaches</li>
                <li>Tacit knowledge transfers more effectively within scenes than through formal channels</li>
                <li>A critical "wacko-to-striver" ratio threshold is necessary for breakthrough innovation</li>
